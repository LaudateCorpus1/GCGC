Quick temporary README. 

Folders:

Jupyter-Everything:  has my testing Jupyter notebook

unusued-code:        Has code to transform an entire log into a CSV file
                     based on the tags and categories presented, with 
                     whitespace handling. Script may require modification for
                     original file (logs lives in /datasets).

datasets:            full and small logs created from different workloads.

bucket_parse:       Currently used work: parses the log looking for a specific
                    field per line, creates a CSV file with the new information,
                    which is read by the notebook. Currently finds log lines 
                    associated with Young generational pauses.

                    Run with "./run_bucket <log_file> <temp_filename> \
                                           <output_csvfile>
