# Notebooks

> If this is your first time using a Jupyter notebook for python3, use the following two tutorials. 
> 1. introduction_to_notebooks.ipynb
> 2. python3_pandas_plotting.ipynb

The notebook compare_any.ipynb is a complete analysis notebook, and only requires a user to edit the first cell. Locally create a copy of this file to do any work, and use the original as a reference.


## Important: 
If you do not know how to start a jupyter notebooks server/kernel required for all notebooks, follow the setup instructions in [setup.md](../../setup.md)
