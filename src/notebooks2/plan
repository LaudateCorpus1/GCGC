Im going to use the apply_restrictions functions within every function, so that the USER has no idea its happening,
but otherwise use the same plotting plan as before. So I just need to update the graphing folder, and make sure
i have a file called like "Apply graphing"

Also, add logrithmic plots.

I shall do this in a check mark. NOTE: THIS UPDATED PLAN ALLOWS FOR ONLY 1 FILE DEMO, no more need for a single
log vs compare logs thing.... but some will make X charts .


The following tables exist:

COMPLETE: Scatter plot : Pauses during runtime 
COMPLETE: Scatter plot : Concurrent durations during runtime
COMPLETE: Pie chart: Time spent in sTW Phases vs. Concurrent Phases
COMPLETE: Bar chart: Time spent in sTW Phases vs. Concurrent Phases
--------------------------------
COMLPETE: Trends: Concurrent Vs Pauses 
COMLPETE: Trends: Concurrent
COMLPETE: Trends: Pauses
COMLPETE: Percentiles: Concurrent Vs Pauses 
COMLPETE: Percentiles: Concurrent
COMLPETE: Percentiles: Pauses
--------------------------------
COMPLETE: Mean durations in miliseconds: Pauses
COMPLETE: Line graph: Heap space used after gc
COMPLETE: Line graph: Heap space used before gc
COMPLETE: Scatter: Reclaimed bytes
COMPLETE: Total time spent in STW concurent events
Frequencies of pauses (buckets)
Average event durations across all logs
