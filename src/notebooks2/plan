Im going to use the apply_restrictions functions within every function, so that the USER has no idea its happening,
but otherwise use the same plotting plan as before. So I just need to update the graphing folder, and make sure
i have a file called like "Apply graphing"

Also, add logrithmic plots.

I shall do this in a check mark. NOTE: THIS UPDATED PLAN ALLOWS FOR ONLY 1 FILE DEMO, no more need for a single
log vs compare logs thing.... but some will make X charts .


The following tables exist:

COMPLETE: Scatter plot : Pauses during runtime 
COMPLETE: Scatter plot : Concurrent durations during runtime
COMPLETE: Pie chart: Time spent in sTW Phases vs. Concurrent Phases
COMPLETE: Bar chart: Time spent in sTW Phases vs. Concurrent Phases
--------------------------------
Trends: Concurrent Vs Pauses 
Trends: Concurrent
Trends: Pauses
Percentiles: Concurrent Vs Pauses 
Percentiles: Concurrent
Percentiles: Pauses
--------------------------------
Mean durations in miliseconds: Pauses
Line graph: Heap space used after gc
Line graph: Heap space used before gc
Scatter: Reclaimed bytes
Frequencies of pauses (buckets)
Total time spent in STW concurent events
Average event duirations across all logs
