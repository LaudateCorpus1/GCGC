Im going to use the filter_and_group functions within every function, so that the USER has no idea its happening,
but otherwise use the same plotting plan as before. So I just need to update the graphing folder, and make sure
i have a file called like "Apply graphing"

Also, add logrithmic plots.

I shall do this in a check mark. NOTE: THIS UPDATED PLAN ALLOWS FOR ONLY 1 FILE DEMO, no more need for a single
log vs compare logs thing.... but some will make X charts .


The following tables exist:

OK: Scatter plot : Pauses during runtime 
OK: Scatter plot : Concurrent durations during runtime
Ok: Bar chart: Time spent in sTW Phases vs. Concurrent Phases
--------------------------------
Ok: Trends: Concurrent Vs Pauses 
Ok: Trends: Concurrent
Ok: Trends: Pauses

Ok: Percentiles: Concurrent Vs Pauses 
Ok: Percentiles: Concurrent
Ok: Percentiles: Pauses
--------------------------------
Ok: Mean durations in miliseconds: Pauses
Ok: Line graph: Heap space used after gc
Ok: Line graph: Heap space used before gc
Ok: Scatter: Reclaimed bytes
-> Total time spent in STW concurent events
Frequencies of pauses (buckets)
Average event durations across all logs
