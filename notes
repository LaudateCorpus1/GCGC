3461136 lines of log, "observed" in 1 second.
(gc.log is the data set)
Running script with printing on above data set = 222 seconds
Running NO printing                            = 38.7 seconds




For a 0.5 GB log file, this is ACCEPTABLE time.... I think it would be better
if it were faster, though.
