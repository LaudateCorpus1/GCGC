Introduce the gc log
show the CMS analyzed by itself, showing the SIMPLICITY of the interface.


-> We can analayze specific metrics of the gc during runtime. Collected is the pause time, concurrent time, and other metrics on the
max event durations, sum of event durations, number of event durations, 

The CMS log generated is from a Cassandra workload for a database.

Phase 1: First, 3 million write  requests are written to the database.
        Then,   3 million read   requests are written to the database. 

Phase 2: 3 million read requests at 25k requests per second are made.

A hypothetical user may be currently using CMS in JDK11, and would like to switch to JDK16 for their JVM.
However, CMS gc is not supported in JDK16, so they will have to choose between one of the available collectors:

ZGC, SHENANDOAH, G1, PARALLEL GC :

(both ZGC & Shenandoah) are concurrent garbage collectors,
while PARALLEL GC and G1 are mostl
