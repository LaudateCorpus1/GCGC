### Parse log files created from Java gc, and create helpful plots and aggregations of data 

> ## How to run analysis
(requirements)
- python3 and used packages (numpy, matplotlib, matplotlib.pyplot, re)
- Jupyter  

(begin analysis)           
1. Navigate to /Jupyter-everything/
2. type  `jupyter notebook`
3. open ``log analysis`` or ``compare_multiple``
4. Use the in-notebook instructions to run analysis

> ### File Structure

- /Jupyter-everything
    - All Jupyter notebook related files. Contains all needed code for this project

- /datasets
   
    - Note: When using a notebook, the 'datasets' file referenced is /Jupyter-everything/datasets. This is not the same folder, but where my actual datasets live: this folder is included in the gitignore. It is recommended that you use this folder for local files
