    - Note: When using a notebook, the 'datasets' file referenced is /Jupyter-everything/datasets. This is not the same folder, but where my actual datasets live: this folder is included in the gitignore
- /Jupyter-everything
    - All Jupyter notebook related files. Contains all needed code for this project
        - /Jupyter-everything/datasets/
            - include a list of symbolic links to local files. To access
the files, download through box using this link [important datasets](https://apple.box.com/s/vcqgyxx8x1jesyj8smc9ow31kpd5u73b)
            - If needed, you can request access to the box folder
